A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is an object used to pass typed data between layers in your application, similar in 
concept to [Structs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)) in C, Martin Fowler's [Transfer
 Objects](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html), or [Value Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object).

The goal of this package is to structure "unstructured data", replacing simple (associative) arrays with a more speaking solution.

- By making all fields typeable, we can be sure that their values are never something we didn't expect. 
Especially with PHP 7.1 and more strict typehinting moving forward this is rather important to detect and fail early.
- We can have full IDE autocomplete and typehinting.
- We can use tools like PHPStan to statically analyze the code (more strictly).
- We can simplify the logic where required fields will now just throw a meaningful exception.
- We can work with different inflections of field names more easily.
- Easy way of immutable DTos with required fields, to trust them in following code.

For more see [Motivation and Background](/docs/Motivation.md).

This plugin will provide you with a tool to quickly generate custom and optimized DTOs for your special use cases.

## Examples

See [Examples](docs/Examples.md) for basic, immutable and complex entity use cases.
The generated demo DTOs of those are in `tests/test_app/src/Dto/`. 


## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

The recommended way to install is:

```
composer require dereuromark/cakephp-dto:dev-master
```

Then load the plugin with the following command:
```
bin/cake plugin load CakeDto -b
```
The bootstrap is needed for the TwigView events to be set up. If you already included TwigView, you might not need the bootstrap.


## Usage

See [Docs](/docs) for details.
